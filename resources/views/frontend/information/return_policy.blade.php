                            <p style="color: black">At BPP Shops, we’re committed to you. We’re able to offer you amazing discounts because we don’t house inventory after our sales end, and therefore cannot process returns except in very limited circumstances. The goods you order, are directly shipped from our China warehouse to your doorstep and therefore cannot process returns except in very limited circumstances.
                                <br> following terms and conditions, apply:
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p style="color: black"> <b> 1) Damaged product: </b> Please check while you receive the product from the courier company. If it's damaged, kindly return it back to the delivery man immediately. Accepting a damaged product will render the return policy ineffective.</p>
                            <p style="color: black"> <b> 2) Wrong delivery: </b> The product delivered, doesn't match with the order details. (e.g. customer ordered size 40 shoe, we sent size 42).
                            <p style="color: black"> <b> 3) Incomplete Product:  </b> For multiple items sometimes, some suppliers delay the delivery. In that case, we send you the goods which we already received in our Local warehouse. So, in this case, please wait another week, to receive other items. You can also track your order from <a herf="#"> bppshops.com </a>
                            <p style="color: black"> <b> 4) Exchanges. We do not accept any Product Exchanges.  </b>

                                If your case should match any of the above-mentioned categories, please take a few close-up photos of the product, attach them to an email mentioning the issue along with your order ID number and fill out the form here bppshops.com. Once you have submitted for a dispute, kindly allow our dedicated disputes team to investigate the issue and they will get back to you within 2 to 5 working days with a resolution.

                               <br>
                               3) Size difference within 1-4 CM due to measurement standards of different manufacturers.
